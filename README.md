#### Description:
*Board Game Tools* is a collection of different modules to support board game players utilizing html, js and css. It was created by Ralf Tischer, Wuppertal, Germany in late 2022 for the Harvard CS50 course.

*Draw Start PLayer* is the first module implemented to randomly draw a start player from a number of players: When playing analogue board games, it is ususlly required to agree on the start player. To support this, module 1 of the collection is started: All players touch the on a canvas of a touchscreen device, each touch is represented by sprinkles in a dedicated randomly drawn color. A countdown timer is started with the last touch represented by a progress bar. During the countdown, little sprinkles in player color are added around the touch position of each player. If a touch is cancelled, the countdown is aborted. At the end of the countdown, one player is randomly selected as start player and displayed with a big circle in player color on his/ her touch position. A new touch restarts the timer after end or abortion.
The application has no control elements except the players' touchs on the screen.
